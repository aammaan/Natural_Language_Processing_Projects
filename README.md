Introduction
Motivation
Have you ever wondered why someone feels a certain way during a conversation? Understanding the reasons behind emotions expressed in dialogue is not just fascinating—it’s essential. Whether it's enhancing dialogue systems or offering better mental health support, grasping these emotional triggers can make a significant difference.

Our project dives into the heart of this challenge: emotion-cause pair extraction. This means identifying the exact words or phrases that spark specific emotions in conversations. Imagine a system that can automatically pinpoint why someone feels happy, sad, or frustrated based on their words. This capability can transform how we analyze emotional expressions, leading to more intuitive dialogue systems and emotionally aware AI.

By developing a robust system to extract these emotion-cause pairs from conversational data, we aim to deepen our understanding of human interactions. This not only helps in academic research but also holds immense practical value. From improving natural language processing to enhancing human-computer interactions, the potential applications are vast. Our work could pave the way for more empathetic and responsive AI, making our interactions with technology feel more human and understanding.
